# ecollect-example-api-client-implementation


Example java client implementation used to connect to the public eCollect v2 API: https://ecollect.org/docs/v2/api/. 

Developed by me in 2020 for the purpose to be free for use by anyone who wants to consider using their services.

Any credentials included have been used for connecting to internal test instances of the api services and are not applicable to any other environments.
